# Daily Consistency Check ✅

This repository is my personal **accountability partner**. 

### The Goal
The mission is simple: **Commit daily.** 

Whether it's a complex feature, a single bug fix, or just a boring documentation tweak, the goal is to keep the streak alive and prioritize **consistency over intensity**.

### The Rules
1. **No zero days.**
2. **Size doesn't matter.** A tiny commit is better than no commit.
3. **Embrace the boring.** Some days are for breakthroughs; others are for maintenance.

> "Long-term consistency trumps short-term intensity."
